# Changelog

Buffer for changes during current development cycle. Migrated to `doc/release/X-Y.md` at each release.

## Format

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD

- Brief description of what was done
- Another change
```

**Guidelines:**
- Date headers in descending order (latest first)
- Terse descriptions - what was done, not phase/cycle numbers
- Migrate to release notes before tagging
