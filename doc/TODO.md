# Marco & Chrissy's Website - TODO

## Task Management via TODO

### Workflow

Tasks in this file follow the systematic planning approach defined in [`PLANNING.md`](PLANNING.md). This ensures consistent, high-quality development that naturally follows the workflow rules in [`CONTRIBUTE.md`](CONTRIBUTE.md).

**Key principle**: Following TODO tasks should automatically result in following our development workflow.

For detailed planning guidance, templates, and examples, see: **[`PLANNING.md`](PLANNING.md)**

## Blocking Issues

#### Task: Clean Up Technical Debt from CLI Setup (Branch: main)

*Problem Statement: Command cascading functionality is already implemented and working, but placeholder test with skip decorator was never updated to provide automated verification.*

**Priority: Clean up before new feature work**
- [ ] Verify command cascading already works: `site deploy` automatically calls `site build` if needed
- [ ] Remove `@pytest.mark.skip(reason="Command cascading not yet implemented")` from `test/e2e/test_site_command.py:51`
- [ ] Implement automated test verification for existing cascading behavior
- [ ] Test that deploy checks for missing/stale output and triggers build automatically
- [ ] Confirm all commands work correctly with existing cascading behavior


#### Task: Fix Shared Components Styling Inconsistency

*Problem Statement: Shared components (navbar, CSS) appear differently between Pelican pages and Galleria pages on production, but work correctly when served locally. This suggests an issue with how shared assets are deployed or referenced.*

- [ ] Compare local vs production shared component rendering between Pelican and Galleria pages
- [ ] Investigate shared asset deployment and referencing inconsistencies  
- [ ] Fix deployment or reference issues to ensure consistent styling across page types

## MVP Roadmap

### Phase 7: Performance Baseline

- [ ] Measure initial performance metrics
  - [ ] Pipeline timing: validate, organize (16s), build (6m4s), deploy step durations
  - [ ] Thumbnail generation: time per photo, batch processing efficiency  
  - [ ] Page weight (HTML + CSS + thumbnails)
  - [ ] Core Web Vitals (FCP, LCP, TTI, CLS, TBT)
  - [ ] Lighthouse scores
  - [ ] Memory usage during gallery generation and deployment
- [ ] Document baseline metrics
- [ ] Create performance tracking spreadsheet
- [ ] Deployment optimization
  - [ ] Compare CDN manifest with local manifest to determine upload needs
  - [ ] Photo collections: lazy upload (only changed files)
  - [ ] Site content: always upload (smaller transfer, less optimization needed)

## Post-MVP Enhancements

#### Task: Add CDN Cache Purge Command

- [ ] Research full Bunny.net API cache management capabilities: tag-based purging (<1s global), wildcard patterns (/galleries/wedding/*), individual URL purging, and other API features that might better suit our deployment patterns
- [ ] Implement `uv run site purge` command with targeted cache invalidation options

#### Task 5.2: Mobile-First Responsive Layout (Branch: ft/responsive-layout)

*Problem Statement: Site lacks mobile optimization with poor touch targets, non-responsive gallery grid, and inconsistent mobile experience across page types.*

**Initial Setup & E2E Test Definition**

- [ ] `git checkout -b ft/responsive-layout`
- [ ] Create E2E test in `test/e2e/test_responsive_layout.py`
  - [ ] Test layout works correctly at mobile viewports (320px, 480px, 768px)
  - [ ] Verify gallery grid adapts from 1→2→4 columns based on screen size
  - [ ] Test touch targets meet 44px minimum requirement
  - [ ] Verify desktop layout maintains full functionality
  - [ ] Add `@pytest.mark.skip("Responsive layout not implemented")`
- [ ] `uv run ruff check --fix --unsafe-fixes && uv run pytest`
- [ ] Update TODO.md and CHANGELOG.md
- [ ] Commit: `Tst: Add E2E test for responsive layout (skipped)`

**Phase 4: PR Creation**

- [ ] `gh pr create --title "Ft: Implement mobile-first responsive layout" --body "Creates responsive design system with touch-friendly navigation, mobile-optimized gallery grid, and consistent mobile experience across all page types"`

### Performance Optimizations  

- [ ] Gallery lazy loading with JS progressive enhancement
- [ ] Basic
- [ ] Parallel thumbnail processing and incremental generation
- [ ] Dark mode toggle (CSS variables + minimal JS)
- [ ] WebP compression optimization

### Shared Component Enhancements

- [ ] **Context-Aware Shared Header**: Replace separate site titles with smart shared header that adapts based on system context
  - **Pattern**: `{% if collection_name %}Gallery: {{ collection_name }}{% elif SITENAME %}{{ SITENAME }}{% endif %}`  
  - **Pelican context**: `SITENAME`, `SITEURL`, `article.title`
  - **Galleria context**: `collection_name`, `page_num`, `total_pages`, `photos|length`
  - **Location**: Create `themes/shared/templates/header.html`, replace both systems' headers
  - **Result**: Consistent header styling with appropriate context (site name vs gallery name)

### Post-Frontend Enhancements Priority Issues

- [ ] **Build Idempotency**: Build regenerates all output files even when source unchanged, breaking incremental deploy
  - [ ] Build should only regenerate files when source files actually change
  - [ ] Preserve timestamps/hashes when content hasn't changed
  - [ ] Enable true incremental deploys (seconds instead of minutes for unchanged source)
  - [ ] Consider build manifest or file dependency tracking
- [ ] **Galleria Performance**: Optimize large photo collection processing (645+ photos cause CPU hang)
- [ ] **Eliminate Hardcoded Paths**: Create PathConfig class for dependency injection, remove `os.chdir()` calls
- [ ] **Plugin Output Validation**: Use structured types (Pydantic) instead of defensive CLI validation
- [ ] **E2E Test Performance**: Fix 16+ second subprocess startup time, consolidate tests

### Code Quality

- [ ] Comprehensive error handling for plugin failures
- [ ] Verify galleria idempotency behavior and manifest-based change detection
- [ ] Enhanced fake image fixtures for EXIF testing
- [ ] Remove dead code (old manifest serializer, thumbnail processor)

### Medium-term Features

- [ ] **External Asset Version Pinning**: Add version control for reproducible builds (config-based pinning with integrity hashes vs lock files) - update themes/shared/utils/asset_manager.py

#### Test Infrastructure

- [ ] **Fixture Refactoring**: Consolidate mock_pelican_config, mock_site_config, and config_file_factory
- [ ] Refactor large integration/e2e tests in galleria plugin system  
- [ ] Create reusable mock plugin factories for consistent test data

#### Gallery Enhancements

- [ ] Galleria plugin system: EXIF display, photo download options, social sharing
- [ ] Gallery search/filter capabilities
- [ ] Multiple photo size options and photographer web-optimized mirror sets
- [ ] JSON data export, RSS feeds, sitemap generation, Open Graph meta tags

#### Site Content

- [ ] Blog/updates section
- [ ] Christmas and vacation galleries  
- [ ] Christmas card pages

#### Infrastructure

- [ ] GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Docker containerization and Ansible automation evaluation
- [ ] CDN optimization with separate bucket strategies

#### Galleria Extraction Preparation  

- [ ] Independence audit (remove parent project dependencies)
- [ ] Technical debt cleanup (type hints, error handling, performance)
- [ ] Evaluate shared schema package with NormPic

#### Long-term Considerations

- [ ] FastAPI/Django/Wagtail integration for dynamic features
- [ ] API endpoints for gallery data
- [ ] Galleria advanced features: video support, RAW processing, cloud storage, GUI tools

## Future Architecture Planning

Post-MVP modularization strategy documented in [Future Architecture](future/). Key goals:

- Extract Galleria as standalone project
- Create SiteForge framework for static+dynamic sites  
- Enable endpoint abstraction (same logic → static/FastAPI/HTMX/edge functions)
- Transform this repo to configuration/deployment hub

## Notes

- Maintain non-JS functionality as primary requirement
- All enhancements must use progressive enhancement
- Performance metrics before and after each optimization
- Keep Galleria extractable for future open-sourcing
- Design plugin interface from day one - modularity is foundational
- Plugin hooks should be lightweight and clearly defined
- Each component should be pluggable without tight coupling
