# Planning Rules

## Overview

There's workflow rules defined in [`doc/CONTRIBUTE.md`](CONTRIBUTE.md).
To make the workflow and rules easier to follow,
tasks defined in [`doc/TODO.md`](TODO.md) should naturally follow those rules.
This means any new person can easily maintain that workflow.
This workflow has a few nested phases.

This is where this document comes into play.
Every time a change is needed,
it's good software engineering practice to
plan out that change into one neat *Pull Request (PR)*.

>**TODO:** Continue planning this and move example tasks from TODO
